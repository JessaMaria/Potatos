### **A Plant Archive of Survival**

We often ask plants questions such as: Where are you native? How many variants exist? What environment do you strive in? What are you most vulnerable to? Humans ask—at times demand—these questions of plants, and the answers are held not only in science, but also by existing communities fighting to preserve their native plants. Each answer is a story, and more and more stories continue to be collected, creating a plant archive of survival. What does the plant archive of the potato tell us? In the public imagination, the potato exists within two dominant narratives.

The first narrative lies in the potato’s monoculture and consumption value as a crop, as different countries and communities have made it a vital part of their diet. As the plant scientist Tiina Särkinen wrote, "We commonly treat the plants beneficial to us—those we cultivate and depend upon—as distinct and disconnected from plant diversity in the wild. But our crops all have their origins in wild biodiversity and have wild ancestors."[^1] One can trace the plant’s ancestry and map its subsequent movement as a crop across geographies and localities, from the mountainous terrain of the Andes across the Atlantic as it was introduced to Europe and back to the American continent.

The second story centers on famine and the risk of monoculture, both to biodiversity and to communities who have become dependent on the monocrop. A punctuated moment in the story of potatoes is the Irish famine of 1845-1852. There are other, lesser known moments when famine was caused by spread of disease that decimated potatoes: in 1843 Pennsylvania, 1921 Soviet Union, and 2003 Papua New Guinea. Given the potato’s vulnerability to disease and climate change, "community conservationists of the Potato Park [in Peru] decided in 2011 to send more than 1,500 seed samples of their own varieties to be stored in the *Svalbard Global Seed Vault*."[^2] has to be fixed Communities and countries within Latin America have aimed to protect its many variants. The International Potato Center, CIP, with its main headquarters in Peru, works with more than 20 countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America to enhance food security.
