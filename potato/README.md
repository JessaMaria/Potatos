### A Plant Archive of Survival

We often ask plants questions such as: Where are you native? How many variants exist? What environment do you strive in? What are you most vulnerable to? Humans ask—at times demand—these questions of plants, and the answers are held not only in science, but also by communities fighting to preserve their native plants. Each answer is a story, and more stories continue to be collected, creating a plant archive of survival. What does the plant archive of the potato tell us? In the public imagination, the potato exists within two dominant narratives.

The first narrative lies in the potato’s monoculture and consumption value as a crop, as different countries and communities have made it a vital part of their diet. As the plant scientist Tiina Särkinen wrote, "We commonly treat the plants beneficial to us—those we cultivate and depend upon—as distinct and disconnected from plant diversity in the wild. But our crops all have their origins in wild biodiversity and have wild ancestors."[^1]

The second narrative centers on famine and the risk of monoculture, both to biodiversity and to communities that have become dependent on the monocrop. Beyond the Irish famine, there are other lesser-known moments when the infection of potato crops caused famine, otherwise known as late blight, that decimated potatoes: in 1843 Pennsylvania, 1921 Soviet Union, and 2003 Papua New Guinea. Given the potato’s vulnerability to disease and climate change, "community conservationists of the Potato Park [in Peru] decided in 2011 to send more than 1,500 seed samples of their own varieties to be stored in the *Svalbard Global Seed Vault*."[^2] Communities and countries within Latin America are taking steps to protect the potato’s many variants. The International Potato Center (CIP), whose main headquarters is in Peru, works with more than twenty countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America to enhance food security.

### A Plant Archive of Resistance: the Edinburgh Potato

Such crossings can be applied to what Carmen Lamas has called the "Latinx return" or "Latin American return," which charts "an endless circuit of arrivals and departures" across existing divides. In her book, The Latino Continuum and the Nineteenth-Century Americas, Lamas explains how, when studying or recovering the lives and experiences of Latinx people, "we find markers—geographic, political, affective, aesthetic, and imaginative—that speak to the comings and goings of Latin Americans to the U.S. and back again to their home countries… They all speak of what I call the Latinx return, an endless circuit of arrivals and departures."[^3] Lamas reminds us that the crossing of the divide does not only have to involve an actual person returning, but also in the circulation of the translated works Latin American authors have published within the United States and Latin America, and more.

Potatoes and the fight to find a genetically resistant variant begs whether the "Latino continuum" can be more-than-human—one found within the texts of plants that are neither entirely Latin American nor European. Gardens, deserts, and the environment are storied archives. When we read each plant and ecosystem as a text, their narratives reflect a historical coming and going. The wild species being brought from Mexico and cultivated to recreate a resistant Edinburgh potato not only offers the chance to read a different "Latin American return" outside of the geographical area of the Americas. But also one that extends beyond published texts and people who return to their country of origin, to include plants. The duration for which the Edinburgh potato will remain resistant is unknown, and scientific research conducted in Edinburgh is ongoing. Research to cultivate a resistant potato will hopefully also benefit not only Latin American countries but also other countries in need, and be conducted collaboratively within their communities.
